# WSL-Utilities by NullCode

## What is this?
It is basically a set of scripts you can use to enable/disable WSL [(Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) and install some distros quickly. I thought this would be useful to people when I was 10, so here you are!

## Minimum system requirements
- A 64 bit computer with Windows 10
- Also needs to be version 1607+ (you can find your OS' version using `winver`)
- Curl.exe in your PATH (I will be removing curl dependency soon)

## Things still left
> I used to think this was a good enough "utility", but now that I look back, there's tons more that need to be done
- [x] ~~Clean-up code~~
- [ ] Remove curl dependency (or add curl directly inside the batch file)
- [ ] GUI maybe hopefully
- [ ] Make code more automated

If you want any features added, do not create an issue. Instead you can hit me up on the [XDA Support Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/script-win-10-wsl-1-2-utility-for-windows-10-x64.4177849/)
