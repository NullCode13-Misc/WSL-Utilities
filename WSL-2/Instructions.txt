# DO NOT DO ANYTHING to the wsl_update file. It is the Linux kernel and it gets called and installed accordingly.
# Make sure you are on Windows 10 20H1 [also called 2004]
> You can do this by pressing Windows Key + R; then typing 'winver' there. If you see Version 2004, you're all good. 

1) Execute 'Enabling WSL #1.bat'.
2) Your system will complete the things and automatically restart after 15 seconds [if it doesn't, then do it yourself].
3) After rebooting, execute 'Enabling WSL #2.bat' and follow instructions.
4) After that, click on Download Distro.bat and download the distro you want [I recommend Kali Linux].
5) After you download the Linux distro, run 'Install Distro.bat'. It will detect the distro and install it for you.

Finally open start menu and run the distro. It will do initial setup and instantly land you to the shell. I won't explain further, just Google anything else that you need :)
